This is not really the 2013 code for the Warlocks robot. It is the basic robot project as created with the 2012 version of Labview.

It has been uploaded as a project to figure out how to use Github and Tortoise Git.

A real 2013 project will be created whan the 2013 software is available and a new project can be created.
